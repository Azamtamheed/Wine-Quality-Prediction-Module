# Wine-Quality-Prediction-Module
In this group project, our primary focus is to perform a comparative analysis and evaluate various types of machine learning models for data science that was used in machine learning algorithms using several classification processes. These machine learning algorithms are Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
The propose of this project is to create a machine learning models that can predict a
highly accurate wine quality using the wine quality dataset provided in the USM
e-learning portal. This data set contains data about the wine contents as the features and
the rating of the wine quality as the target. This also allows us to determines which
models give a high prediction and a better performance by using three different machine
learning algorithms which are Random Forest, KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours), and SVM
(Support Vector Machine).
Firstly, we will explore the performance of each of our models using different data
splitting ratios which are 60:40, 70:30, and 80:20 by allocating the greater portion of the
data into the training set and the rest for the testing set. The ratio that gives a highly
accurate prediction will be chosen to test different feature selection methods. Then, we
will use feature selection such as feature importance, correlation matrix using heatmap,
and univariate selection to enhance the modelâ€™s predictive power and reduce potential
noise by keeping the top four features by each feature selection technique
