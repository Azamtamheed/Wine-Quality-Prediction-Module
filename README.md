# Wine-Quality-Prediction-Module
In this group project, our primary focus is to perform a comparative analysis and evaluate various types of machine learning models for data science that was used in machine learning algorithms using several classification processes. These machine learning algorithms are Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
